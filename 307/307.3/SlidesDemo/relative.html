  <h1>Position Relative</h1>

  <p>The <strong>element</strong> is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset relative to itself based on
    the values of top, right, bottom, and left.
    <strong>The offset does not affect the position of any other elements;</strong> thus, the
    space given for the element in the page layout is the same as if position were static.</p>
